## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

#read in Dataset
```{r}
Df <- read_excel("GlobalLandCove_ComputeChange_ExportTable_TableToExcel.xlsx")

```


```{r}

# Make sure that df is indeed a dataframe or tibble
Df <- as.data.frame(Df)

# Use dplyr's mutate to categorize 'Class_From' and remove rows with "Same"
Cleaned_Data <- Df %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Class = dplyr::case_when(
    Class_From == "Same" ~ NA_character_,
    Class_From %in% c("Closed Canopy Broadleaved Deciduous Tree Cover",
